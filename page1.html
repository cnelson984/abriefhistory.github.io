		<p>Doors have been allowing people to walk through walls since the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
		<p>Early house-dwellers were frustrated when, after all of the hard work it took them to build their homes, they were unable to get inside.  Numerous people died after being exposed to the elements, unable to seek shelter in the comfort of their house.</p>
		<p>In 1906, Geoffrey Von Door, a recent immigrant from Germany, had an idea to cut a hole in the wall of his house and replace it with a large piece of wood.  This allowed him to simply walk in and out of his home, without having to tear down and replace the wall every time.  He eventually modified his invention to include hinges on which the "door," as it came to be known, could swing freely.</p>
