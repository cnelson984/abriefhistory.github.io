		<p>Hipsters are a trendy group of young adults, typically associated with the millenial generation.  They generally like old things for the sake of being quirky/different/whatever.  For example, the beer Pabst Blue Ribbon, though it has declined in popularity since the early nineties and it is questionable whether the person who originally awarded it a blue ribon was qualified to do so, has seen a resurgence in sales due to hipsters having nostalgia for it, even though they were children or not yet born the last time PBR was popular.</p>
		<p>Another element that defines the modern hipster is beards and moustaches.  Generally speaking, hipsters will have very bushy beards and/or curly moustaches that hark to an era during which they, once again, were not alive and cannot actually be nostalgic for.</p>
		<p>Hipsters are a continuously evolving group and their styles and affects may change with the times.  Click <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_(contemporary_subculture)">here</a> to keep up.</p>
