      <h3 class="w3-text-purple">Editor-in-Chief</h3>
      <p>Conrad is the founder of the "A Brief History" project.  He is currently an undergraduate student at UNH-Manchester pursuing a Bachelor's degree in American History and also holds an Associate's degree in Criminal Justice from New Hampshire Technical Institute, which means that he is in no way qualified to be telling you anything about the subjects presented in this web site.  <a href="conrad.html" class="w3-hover-text-grey">Click here for additional information about Conrad</a>.</p>

      <h1>Success Kid</h1>
      <h3 class="w3-text-purple">Chief Motivation Officer</h3>
      <p>Success Kid's purpose in the "A Brief History" project is somewhat vague.  He doesn't actually "do" anything.  This isn't really his fault, because he's a baby and babies are generally useless when it comes to research, web design, or most other things.  However, he fulfills an important role in the project: Motivation.  Success Kid reminds us of our achievements and makes our day brighter, giving us the strength to continue putting out poor- to mediocre-quality content.</p>
